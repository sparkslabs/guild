Python-Guild
============

## Abstract ##
Guild is a basic pipelineable Actor system, currently based around threads
and a developer friendly syntax. In particular it introduces 2 notions to an
actor system - the idea of late binding, and of having common names (or aliases)
for the purposes of enabling pipelining.

It's inspired by Kamaelia, but with all the ugly parts removed.

The ability to have dynamic actor methods would be useful.

## Introduction/Overview ##

At present the documentation is the code itself. That's not great documentation,
so this file consists of an overview of Guild.

Guild is a python library for creating thread based applications.

Threads are represented using actors - objects with threadsafe methods.
Calling a method puts a message on an inbound queue for execution within the
thread.  Guild actors can also have stub actor methods, representing output. 
These are stub methods which are expected to be rebound to actor methods on
other actors.  These stub methods are called late bind methods.  This allows
pipelines of Guild actors to be created in a similar way to Unix pipelines.

Additionally, Guild actors can be active or reactive. A reactive actor
performs no actions until a message is received.  An active guild actor can
be active in two main ways: it can either repeatedly perform an action, or
more complex behaviour can use a generator in a coroutine style.  The use of
a generator allows Guild actors to be stopped in a simpler fashion than
traditional python threads.  Finally, all Guild actors provide a default
'output' late-bindable method, to cover the common case of single input,
single output.

Finally, Guild actors are just python objects and actors with additional
functionality - it's designed to fit in with your code, not the other way
round. This post covers some simple examples of usage of Guild, and how
it differs (slightly) from traditional actors.

## Getting and Installing ##

Installation is pretty simple:

    :::bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild
    $ cd guild
    $ sudo python setup.py install

If you'd prefer to build, install and use a debian package:

    :::bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild
    $ cd guild
    $ make deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i ../python-guild_1.0.0_all.deb

## Example: viewing a webcam ##

This example shows the use of two actors - webcam capture, and image
display.  The thing to note here is that we could easily add other actors
into the mix - for network serving, recording, analysis, etc.  If we did,
the examples below can be reused as is.

First of all the code, then a brief discussion.

    :::python
    import pygame, pygame.camera, time
    from guild.actor import *
    pygame.camera.init()

    class Camera(Actor):
        def gen_process(self):
            camera = pygame.camera.Camera(pygame.camera.list_cameras()[0])
            camera.start()
            while True:
                yield 1
                frame = camera.get_image()
                self.output(frame)
                time.sleep(1.0/50)

    class Display(Actor):
        def __init__(self, size):
            super(Display, self).__init__()
            self.size = size

        def process_start(self):
            self.display = pygame.display.set_mode(self.size)

        @actor_method
        def show(self, frame):
            self.display.blit(frame, (0,0))
            pygame.display.flip()

        input = show

    camera = Camera().go()
    display = Display( (800,600) ).go()
    pipeline(camera, display)
    time.sleep(30)
    stop(camera, display)
    wait_for(camera, display)

In this example, Camera is an active actor. That is it sits
there, periodically grabbing frames from the webcam.  To do this, it uses a
generator as a main loop.  This allows the fairly basic behaviour of
grabbing frames for output to be clearly expressed.  Note also this actor
does use the normal blocking sleep function.

The Display Actor initialises by capturing the passed parameters. Once the
actor has started, its process_start method is called, enabling it to
create a display, it then sits and waits for messages.  These arrive when a
caller calls the actor method 'show' or its alias 'input'.  When that
happens the upshot is that the show method is called, but in a threadsafe
way - and it simply displays the image.

The setup/tear down code shows the following:

* Creation of, and starting of, the Camera actor
* Creation and start of the display
* Linking the output of the Camera to the Display
* The main thread then waits for 30 seconds - ie it allows the program to run for 30 seconds.
* The camera and display actors are then stopped
* And the main thread waits for the child threads to exit before exitting itself.

This could be simplified (and will be), but it shows that even though the
actors had no specific shut down code, they shut down cleanly this way.

## Example: following multiple log files looking for events ##

This example follows two log files, and grep/output lines matching a given
pattern.  In particular, it maps to this kind of command line:

    :::bash
    $ (tail -f x.log & tail -f y.log) | grep pants

This example shows that there are still some areas that would benefit from
additional syntactic sugar when it comes to wiring together pipelines.  In
particular, this example should be writable together like this:

    :::python
    Pipeline( Parallel( Follow("x.log"), Follow("y.log"),
              Grep("pants"),
              Printer() ).run()

However, I haven't implemented the necessary chassis yet (they will be).

Once again, first the code, then a discussion.

    :::python
    from guild.actor import *
    import re, sys, time

    class Follow(Actor):
        def __init__(self, filename):
            super(Follow, self).__init__()
            self.filename = filename
            self.f = None

        def gen_process(self):
            self.f = f = file(self.filename)
            f.seek(0,2)   # seek to end
            while True:
                yield 1
                line = f.readline()
                if not line: # no data, so wait
                    time.sleep(0.1)
                else:
                    self.output(line)

        def onStop(self):
            if self.f:
                self.f.close()

    class Grep(Actor):
        def __init__(self, pattern):
            super(Grep, self).__init__()
            self.regex = re.compile(pattern)

        @actor_method
        def input(self, line):
            if self.regex.search(line):
                self.output(line)

    class Printer(Actor):
        @actor_method
        def input(self, line):
            sys.stdout.write(line)
            sys.stdout.flush()

    follow1 = Follow("x.log").go()
    follow2 = Follow("y.log").go()
    grep = Grep("pants").go()
    printer = Printer().go()

    pipeline(follow1, grep, printer)
    pipeline(follow2, grep)
    wait_KeyboardInterrupt()
    stop(follow1, follow2, grep, printer)
    wait_for(follow1, follow2, grep, printer)

As you can see, like the bash example, we have two actors that tail/follow
two different log files.  These both feed into the same 'grep' actor that
matches the given pattern, and these are finally passed to a Printer actor
for display.  Each actor shows slightly different aspects of Guild's model.

* **Follow** is an active actor. It captures the filename to follow in the
  initialiser, and creates a placeholder for the associated file handle. The
  main loop them follows the file, calling its output method when it has a
  line.  Finally, it will continue doing this until its .stop() method is
  called.  When it is, the generator is killed (via a StopIteration
  exception being passed in), and the actor's onStop method is called
  allowing the actor to close the file.

* **Grep** is a simple reactive actor with some setup. In particular, it
  takes the pattern provided, compiles a regex matcher using it. Then any
  actor call to its input method results in any matching lines to be passed
  through via its output method.

* **Printer** is a simple reactive actor. Any actor call to its input
  method results in the data passed in being sent to stdout.

#### Work in progress ####

**It is worth noting that Guild at present is not a mature library yet,**
**but is sufficiently useful for lots of tasks.** In particular, one area
Guild will improve on in - specifying coordination more compactly.  For
example, the Camera example could become:

    :::python
    Pipeline( Camera(),  Display( (800,600) ) ).run()

That's a work in progress however, adding with other chassis, and other
useful parts of kamaelia.

## What are actors? ##

Actors are threads with a mailbox allowing them to receive and act upon
messages.  In the above webcam example, it has 2 threads, one for capturing
images, and one for display.  Images from the webcam end up in the mailbox
for the display, which displays images it receives.  Often actor libraries
wrap up the action of sending a message to the mailbox of an actor via a
method on the thread object.

The examples above demonstrate this above via the decorated methods:

* Display.show, Grep.input, Printer.input

All of these methods - when called by a client of the actor - take all the
arguments passed in, along with their function and place on the actor's
mailbox (a thread safe queue).  The actor then has a main loop that checks
this mailbox and executes the method within the thread.

## How does Guild differ from the actor model? ##

In a traditional actor model, the code in the camera Actor might look like
this:

    #!python hl_lines="6 7 8 16"
    import pygame, pygame.camera, time
    from guild.actor import *
    pygame.camera.init()

    class Camera(Actor):
        def __init__(self, display):
            super(Camera, self).__init__()
            self.display = display

        def gen_process(self):
            camera = pygame.camera.Camera(pygame.camera.list_cameras()[0])
            camera.start()
            while True:
                yield 1
                frame = camera.get_image()
                self.display.show(frame)
                time.sleep(1.0/50)

* **NB: This is perfectly valid in Guild.** If you don't want to use the
  idea of late bound methods or pipelining, then it can be used like any other
  actor library.

If you did this, the display code would not need any changes. The start-up
code that links things together though would now need to look like this:

    :::python hl_lines="1 2 3"
    display = Display( (800,600) ).go()
    camera = Camera(display).go()
    # No pipeline line anymore
    time.sleep(30)
    stop(camera, display)
    wait_for(camera, display)

On the surface of things, this looks like a simplification, and on one level
it is - we've removed one line from the program start-up code.  Our camera
object however now has its destination embedded at object initialisation and
it's also become more complex, with zero increase in flexibility.  In fact
I'd argue you've *lost* flexibility, but I'll leave why for later.

For example, suppose we want to record the images to disk, we can do this by
adding a third actor that can sit in the middle of others:

    :::python
    import time, os
    class FrameStore(Actor):
        def __init__(self, directory='Images', base='snap'):
            super(FrameStore, self).__init__()
            self.directory = directory
            self.base = base
            self.count = 0

        def process_start(self):
            os.makedir(self.directory)
            try:
                os.makedirs("Images")
             except OSError, e:
                if e.errno != 17: raise

        @actor_method
        def input(self, frame):
            self.count += 1
            now = time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S",time.localtime())
            filename = "%s/%s-%s-%05d.jpg" % (self.directory, self.base, now, self.count)
            pygame.image.save(frame, filename)
            self.output(frame)

This could then be used in a Guild pipeline system this way:

    :::python hl_lines="2 4"
    camera = Camera().go()
    framestore = FrameStore().go()
    display = Display( (800,600) ).go()
    pipeline(camera, framestore, display) 
    time.sleep(30)
    stop(camera, framestore, display) 
    wait_for(camera, framestore, display)

It's for this reason that Guild supports late bindable actor methods.

What's happening here is that the definition of Actor includes this:

    :::python
    class Actor(object):
        #...
        @late_bind_safe
        def output(self, *argv, **argd):
            pass

That means every actor has available "output" as a late bound actor method.

This pipeline called:

    :::python
    pipeline(camera, display)

Essentially does this:

    :::python
    camera.bind("output", display, "input")

This transforms to a threadsafe version of this:

    :::python
    camera.output = display.input

As a result, it replaces the call camera.output with a call to display.input
for us - meaning that it is as efficient to do camera.output as it is to do
self.display.show in the example above - but significantly more flexible.

There are lots of fringe benefits of this - which are best discussed in later
posts, but this does indicate best how Guild differs from the usual actor
model.


### Why write and release this? ###

About a year ago, I was working on a project with an aim of investigating
various ideas relating to of the Internet of Things. (In particular, which
definition of that really mattered to us, why, and what options it provided)

As part of that project, I wrote a small/just big enough library suitable
for testing some ideas I'd had regarding integrating some ideas in Kamaelia,
with the syntactic sugar in the actor model.  Essentially, to map Kamaelia's
inboxes and messages to traditional actor methods, and maps outboxes to late
bound actor methods.  Use of standard names and/or aliases would allow
pipelining.

Guild was the result, and it's proven itself useful in a couple of
projects, hence its packaging as a standalone library.  Like all such
things, it's a work in progress, but it also has a cleaner to use version of
Kamaelia's STM code, and includes some of the more useful components like
pipelines and backplanes.

If you find it useful or spot a typo, please let me know.
